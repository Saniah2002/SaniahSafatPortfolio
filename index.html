                    About Me
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Hello,I am Saniah Safat. I am an international student at The University of Texas at Arlington from Dhaka, Bangladesh.
                    I am set to graduate in August 2024 with an Honors Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Engineering. Throughout my 
                    undergraduate journey, I had held multiple on-campus jobs, which have enhanced my educational experience 
                    as well as my leadership and communication skills.
                    In the summer of 2024, I will be beginning an internship at the Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation(PCCI), a data 
                    science driven research institute under Parkland Hospitals as a Sachs Sum Scholars Intern. This opportunity will allow 
                    me to apply my academic knowledge in real-world settings, further preparing me for graduate studies.
                </p>
